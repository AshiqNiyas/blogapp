        <h3>Which is the best frontend framework?</h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="../images/vue react ang.jpeg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50 p-lg-2">
            <h4 class="py-2">1.React</h4>
        <p>React is actually a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, but it’s more often called a frontend framework. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, a developer at Facebook. In 2013, React became an open-source framework and began to grow in popularity. Today, frontend development teams at business giants such as PayPal, Netflix, Walmart, Tesla, and more, use React, which proves the high quality and reliability of this tool.</p>

           <p> Developers working with React use JavaScript and declarative code. A special JSX feature allows them to use HTML for updating the DOM (Document Object Model) and to create a Virtual DOM, which results in better performance.</p>

           <br>

           <h4>2.Angular js</h4>
        <p>Angular is a powerful open-source frontend development framework created by Google in 2010. You can find Angular on all the lists of popular frontend frameworks. This should come as no surprise, as this JavaScript framework boasts superb performance and useful functional features, including directives, filters, two-way data binding, dependencies and more.</p>


           <p>Large companies such as BMW and Forbes base their applications on Angular, attesting to the high quality of this framework.</p>

           <br>

           <h4>3.Vue js</h4>
        <p>The release of Vue 3.0 in 2020 was a long-awaited event by developers all over the world, and the version has fulfilled expectations. It was fully rewritten in TypeScript, which provides more benefits in agile development; packages have become smaller; new APIs for solving large-scale tasks have appeared. In addition, Vue supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), providing more development opportunities.</p>

           <p>Don’t use Vue.js for large projects if you don’t have developers with a strong background in this framework, since the community may not always help with issues; the stability of some components may be questionable.</p>
