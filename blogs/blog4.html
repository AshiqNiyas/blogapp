        <h3>Best vscode themes</h3>

        <img src="../images/theme.png" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50 p-lg-2">
            <h4 class="py-2">1. One Dark Pro</h4>
        <p>One Dark Pro is one of the best dark themes for VS Code. Unsurprisingly, it’s also one of the most downloaded themes on the Visual Studio Code marketplace. Like other great VS Code themes, One Dark Pro has a default look and several color theme variations. This makes it easy to switch between the available options and find your perfect match..</p>

           <p> The theme quickly highlights the different components of your code with high-contrast colors. It also allows for customization if you want it. It’s a perfect fit for both night and daylight conditions.</p>

           <br>

           <h4>2. GitHub Theme</h4>
        <p>This theme is for you if you like how GitHub displays code. GitHub itself created the theme, and it’s one of the best light themes for VS Code. You get the same subtle colors with your code elements well highlighted, just like on GitHub.</p>


           <p>The theme also includes several color themes to choose from, including dark color themes and light ones in various shades to suit different people and conditions. Plus, like most VS Code themes, you can customize the theme further by following VS Code's Extension guide. Go with the GitHub Theme if you’d like consistency in design between your VS Code editor and GitHub.</p>

           <br>

           <h4>3. Night Owl</h4>
        <p>As the name suggests, Night Owl was specifically created for programmers who love writing code during the night. Although it also has a theme dedicated to daytime use, it was primarily created for night usage. Instead of using bright colors like One Dark Pro, Night Owl uses muted, yet high-contrast colors, to make it easier to code at night.</p>

           <p>Colors for functions, variables, and other code elements have been carefully considered. As a result, Night Owl even supports those with color blindness. Instead of providing lots of color themes, Night Owl keeps it simple by providing the same color theme with italics or no italics, which certainly helps as you don't have to try out a myriad of color options to use it..</p>
